                                Skyrim, also known as the Old Kingdom, Throat of the World, the Fatherland or Keizaal
                                <b> (Dragon Language: KEiZAaL Keiz-Aal, "Rebellion-May") </b> , is a vast region set in
                                the
                                northern part of Tamriel.It is the home of the Nords, large and hardy men and women who
                                have a strong resistance to frost, both natural and magical. Skyrim was originally
                                inhabited by a race of Mer known as the Snow Elves, though after the Nordic-Falmer War,
                                the
                                Snow Elves were mostly destroyed and the Atmorans settled the land. It is bordered by
                                Morrowind to the east, the Nibenay and Colovia in Cyrodiil to the south, Hammerfell to
                                the
                                southwest, and High Rock to the west. The island of Solstheim lies to the northeast of
                                Skyrim, now a sovereign territory of Morrowind.

                                During the Merethic Era, a legendary Atmoran leader named Ysgramor led an expedition
                                from
                                Atmora, across the Sea of Ghosts to the land that would later be known as
                                Skyrim. They called the land Mereth, in recognition of the vast number of Mer that
                                lived there. It was the first region of Tamriel to be settled by humans. According to
                                legend, Ysgramor landed first at Hsaarik Head, at the extreme northern tip of Skyrim's
                                Broken Cape. It is said that he and his companions were fleeing the civil war in Atmora,
                                which at that time had a sizable population.

                                The Atmorans settled the area that in the future would be known as Winterhold; they
                                eventually built a city in the region and named it Saarthal. For a long while, relations
                                between the Snow Elves and the Atmorans were relatively peaceful

                                                The Argonians were created by the Hist, a race of sapient spore trees.
                                                The Argonians were given life, form, and purpose by these creators.
                                                Their roots run deep beneath the soil and soft white limestone of Black
                                                Marsh, connecting them all, and thus connecting the Saxhleel. As the
                                                Hist are all connected at the roots, they have a collective
                                                consciousness, and can communicate with each other. Ancient cave
                                                paintings depict half-tree, half-Argonian figuresâ€”some of which appear
                                                to be more tree-like than Argonian
